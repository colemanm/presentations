I'm talking today about some new and interesting directions for the geo industry. Areas that are exciting for folks in the GIS industry, and where we're headed

---

Intro - My name is Coleman, Vice President of Spatial Networks. I've been with SNI for 4 years now, and have a history in traditional GIS in the civil engineering space. I'm subbing in for Tony, our CEO, who had to travel this week.

---

SNI is a mapping and software dev shop in the Tampa area, founded in 2000. Deep focus on international consulting work for competitive intel, business geography, and mapping - answering difficult questions in difficult places. About 5-6 years ago, we started developing our own software tools for mobile mapping and field collection, and have largely refashioned ourselves as a development studio - but still retaining a depth of services work, and our unabashed bias to geography and location data.

---

A couple of our primary software projects:

Fulcrum:
Our flagship product. A cloud-based, customizable data collection platform. Web app for designing field data collection forms, and a companion set of mobile apps for iOS and Android for deploying forms to the field and doing location-based data collection.

Pushpin:
A sister project of Fulcrum - mobile app for editing and contributing data to OpenStreetMap. For those that don't know OSM, it's the "wikipedia" of maps, essentially - the world map that anyone can edit. Can add POIs, edit streets, bus routes, lakes, rivers, on and on. We've had over 1000 users make edits to OSM with Pushpin, and built a stats page and leaderboard, to almost build a game around making contributions. Over 60,000 edits have been made to improve the map. Edits in 100 different countries.

Roughly 200 edits or additions have been made in the last 24 hours. This is an open source, open dataset that gets better every minute. More about OSM later in the talk.

Tie it to map maker...

My talk is about where we're headed in the geography space - not just GIS as a discipline, but geography as a science and location-based tools as an integral part of peoples' lives.

---

To start off, geography is ubiquitous - both in the literal sense (as in we're always in a place, going to a place, thinking about a place), but also in terms of technology. There's hardly a technology or software that doesn't contain maps, or data that doesn't contain location information. A couple of points to demonstrate this:

---

Maps are now critical components of nearly all software. Business + personal alike. Foursquare, Twitter, and Facebook are obvious social tools with a focus on "where". People now use maps in all sorts of ways thanks to key tech like Google Maps + Google Earth - not just the realm of government or special industries anymore.

---

People are sensors. There are millions of smartphones out there, each a sensor producing data - passively or with user intent. Smartphones have clocks, cameras, IR sensors, and most importantly, GPS.

---

Datastreams are now spatial by default. Capabilities exist now even to generate more data than can be consumed or analyzed. And all of these location-enabled datastreams add the ability for space to become context. Helps users to see relationships in space, in addition to time.

---

I want to cover 3 major themes I think are important to the future of the industry - 3 things that not only can we not ignore, but we should be embracing, since everyone in this room has a unique ability to understand the value of geography as an aspect to everything.

---

New tools for collaboration and sharing. Tools that make it easier, faster, and cheaper for those doing mapping to work together, and new sources of capacity for creating useful geo information.

---

I want to talk about the growth of the community, and why the spread of mapping tech is a huge deal for anyone working in the geo space

---

And also education - not so much higher ed, but to speak to the point that came up during Keith's plenary yesterday as to the importance of geo as a fundamental component at the elementary level. What we can do to take new, more approachable tools and technology, and teach our youth the value of geography - and also make it FUN to learn about and make maps.

---

First up, collaboration tools

---

new tools enabling

---

new data

---

new users

---

new contributors

---

invites _active participation_ by communities

---

GitHub

version control -> websites -> GIS data management

code -> documents -> data

---

(Chicago GitHub data)

---

(Boston GitHub)

---

Data becomes a living resource

clone -> modify -> pull request

---

Geogit

---

Distributed versioned storage

for map data

---

geojson.io

Mere mortals can draw / publish geodata

(whether they know it or not)

---

(geojson data)

map of neighborhoods I made for a friend, can send a link - even embed a map on a website

---

this is cool:

smart (and passionate) people can volunteer to help (citizen engagement)

data improves

Maps of ethnic group distribution in South Sudan. This is a country that just won independence in 2011, the world's newest country. Sudan, like most other African nations, is a complex country - 600 ethnic groups speaking 400 different languages. Cultural geography is incredibly important in understanding places, but until recently, most of these organizations like OCHA (office for coordination of humanitarian affairs) didn't do much with maps and data. Now they're a critical piece in the communication of these global issues.

burning man - the crazy arts festival out west. The organizers of Burning Man actually used our software tools to map the locations of art installations in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada. These are definitely _not_ your traditional geograpers. But with good tools, they CAN BE, and find new ways to understand landscapes, and communicate spatially.

---

transparency

honest use of taxpayer dollars, publishing tools make it easier than sharing historically has been

---

geo is spreading

---

industries like: real estate, humanitarian aid / disaster response, telecommunications, market research, on and on

---

mappers brought into the fold from different interests: cycling, kayaking, bird watching, hiking, skiing
